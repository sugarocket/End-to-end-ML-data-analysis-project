# End-to-end ML data analysis project
 An end-to-end machine learning project for predicting wine quality
## The problem:
In this project, the usecase I picked is develop a supervised learning model which is useful to support the oenologist wine tasting evaluations and improve wine production. The goal is to model and predict wine quality based on physicochemical test observations. Results can be used to improve winemaking by identifying the most influential factors and to stratify wines such as premium brands. The performance will be measured by the accuency(precision,recall,etc.) and MSE
